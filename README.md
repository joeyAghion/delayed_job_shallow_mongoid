delayed_job_shallow_mongoid
===========================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/joeyAghion/delayed_job_shallow_mongoid.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/joeyAghion/delayed_job_shallow_mongoid)

This library short-circuits serialization of [Mongoid](http://mongoid.org) model instances when a delayed job is called on them, or when they're passed as arguments to a delayed job. Rather than generate and store the fully-serialized YAML, a simple stub is stored. When the job is run, the stub is recognized and a `find` is done to look up the underlying document. If a referenced model isn't found at this point, the job simply does nothing.
